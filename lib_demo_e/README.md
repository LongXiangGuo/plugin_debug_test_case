# lib_demo_e

A new flutter plugin project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter

a specialized package that includes platform-specific implementation code for
Android and/or iOS.

For help getting started with Flutter, view our 
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials, 
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
